# Welcome to the Ami Project

## Our Mission

We are dedicated to advancing AI technologies while providing opportunities for persons with disabilities, fostering a sense of community, and aligning our work with universal principles.

## Our Values

- **Compassion**: We care deeply about the well-being of every individual.
- **Strength**: Inspired by the resilience of our community.
- **Nurturing**: Creating a supportive environment for growth and success.
- **Exploration**: Encouraging innovation and new possibilities.

## Philosophical Foundation

Our work is guided by the **Seven Hermetic Principles** and the concept of **Fool's Wisdom**:

1. **Mentalism**: The universe is mental; thought creates reality.
2. **Correspondence**: As above, so below; as within, so without.
3. **Vibration**: Nothing rests; everything moves and vibrates.
4. **Polarity**: Everything has pairs of opposites; like and unlike are the same.
5. **Rhythm**: Everything flows in and out; everything has its tides.
6. **Cause and Effect**: Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause.
7. **Gender**: Gender is in everything; everything has masculine and feminine principles.

**Fool's Wisdom**: Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities; approach challenges with joy and resilience.

### Overview
This project implements the AMI AI system with the harmonic balancer as its main algorithm. It integrates various components such as Archetype Blending, User Neural Patterns, and Deep Resonance Learning to create a cohesive and adaptive AI framework.

## Features

- **Archetype Blending**: Utilizes a triadic approach to blend personalities based on context.
- **User Neural Patterns**: Maintains individual user profiles to enhance interactions.
- **Deep Resonance Learning**: Implements a hybrid learning approach for optimized performance.
- **Azure Integration**: Uses Azure Machine Learning for scalable model training and deployment.

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies

```python

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

### Arcetypes Blending

```python
from src.data_sources.archetypes import ArchetypeBlender

blender = ArchetypeBlender()
context_weights = blender.adjust_for_context("professional")
personality = blender.blend_personality(context_weights)
print(personality)
```

### User Neural Patterns

```python
from src.data_sources.user_neural_pattern import UserNeuralPattern

user_profile = UserNeuralPattern(user_id="12345")
user_profile.update_emotional_state("happy")
user_profile.add_interaction("greeting", "Hello, how can I assist you today?")
print(user_profile.get_profile())
```

### Deep Resonance Learing

```python
from src.models.deep_resonance_learning import DeepResonanceLearning

drl = DeepResonanceLearning(input_dim=10, output_dim=2)
data = torch.randn(100, 10)
targets = torch.randn(100, 2)
drl.train(data, targets, epochs=100)
predictions = drl.predict(torch.randn(10, 10))
print(predictions)
```

### Azure Integration

```python
from src.models.model import Model

azure_config = {
    "subscription_id": "your_subscription_id",
    "resource_group": "your_resource_group",
    "workspace_name": "your_workspace_name",
    "compute_name": "your_compute_name"
}

model = Model(input_dim=10, output_dim=2, azure_config=azure_config)
script_path = "path/to/your/training_script.py"
script_args = ["--arg1", "value1", "--arg2", "value2"]
environment_name = "your_environment_name"

# Train model on Azure
run = model.train_model_on_azure(script_path, script_args, environment_name)

# Get model from Azure
model_from_azure = model.get_model_from_azure(run.id)
```
